      "        \"description\": \"Abstract Geographic variation in trees has been investigated since the mid-18th century. Similar patterns of clinal variation have been observed along latitudinal and elevational gradients in common garden experiments for many temperate and boreal species. These studies convinced forest managers that a \\u2018local is best\\u2019 seed source policy was usually safest for reforestation. In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and refined but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene flow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene flow (AGF), the translocation of pre-adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufficiently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species-specific knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty. New knowledge will continue to refine and improve AGF as climates warm further.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Abstract 1. Global change ecologists have often used trees under weak competition (e.g., dominant/codominant trees) to examine relationships between climatic change and tree growth. Scaling up these results to a forest relies on the assumption that the climatic change-tree growth relationship is not affected by tree-level competition. 2. Using permanent sample plot data from the central Canadian boreal region where warming did not result in water deficit, we tested the above-mentioned assumption by looking at whether the relationship between climatic change and tree growth varied with tree-level competition, which was quantified using a modified Hegyi competition index. 3. We found that tree growth increased over time for trees under weak competition, but decreased for those under strong competition. The divergent temporal trends among trees under different levels of competition led to a non-significant change in growth for our study plots. Growth increased with regional warming, atmospheric [CO2] and water availability for trees under weak competition, but not for those under strong competition. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that upscaling the growth responses of dominant/codominant trees to climate change to a forest or a region can lead to biased estimates. Tree-level competition should be taken into account when expressing climatic change and tree growth relationships.\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Urban trees play an essential role in alleviating the local effects of global warming by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide, regulating temperature and reducing air pollution in urban areas. There have been studies estimating carbon sequestration of urban trees using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Yet, neither of the studies made comparison between species nor extended the discussion towards ecosystem services. Therefore, this study compared the attributes between native and cultivated trees in the Asian Garden of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Botanical Garden, estimated their level of above-ground carbon sequestration, and thus examined respective implications in terms of ecosystem services. A canopy height model was first generated from LiDAR point cloud data for individual tree segmentation based on Dalponte algorithm. There were 803 derived trees matched successfully with the field-measured trees in ArcGIS with an accuracy of 69.5%. The level of above-ground carbon sequestration of each tree was estimated from tree height and canopy area using a non-linear regression model. Results showed that the average carbon sequestration level of native trees was higher than cultivated trees by 1102 kg (p = 3.045 x 10-7), which facilitated more effective soil formation. The average canopy areas of both trees were approximately 63 m2 (p = 0.696), which gives rise to their similar contribution in temperature cooling and air purification. In general, the garden provides a high level of biodiversity and education value thanks to its high species diversity. Regarding future directions in garden management, the removal of native trees and the planting location of cultivated trees in the garden should be carefully evaluated since they have higher level of ecosystem services and higher crown area to height ratio respectively.\",\n",

This research was done to ascertain whether the transition from traditional news mediums to social news mediums has the potential to thin the divide between the scientific consensus on climate change and the public's perception of climate change science. Primary data was collected form the social media platform, Twitter, and a literature review was performed to answer this research question. The primary research revealed where influence resides on Twitter while the literature review incorporated psychological factors, factors related to social media algorithms, and the influence of journalistic norms.\",\n",

      "    \"description\": \"The Silver Spring Barn 2 was built in 1867 in the Ottawa Valley\\u2019s region which was known for its rich soils. It was owned by the Bearman Brothers which were second generation Irish settlers. It is currently used as a residence and workplace program for the mentally and physically disabled by the Association for persons with Developmental Disabilities. The farm now produces 40 000 garlic cloves a year. It has been recognized as a federal heritage building since September 28, 1989 and is the only designated National Capital Commission (NCC) barn in the Greenbelt. The sale of spring water is done at the farm as well. In 1989 the farm was deemed a Recognized Federal Heritage Building. The barn was built with the same scientific designs used for farm buildings at the time. Due to many of these buildings falling apart or being torn down for modern barns, the ones on Silver Springs Farm have not only lasted all these years but are also still functioning. While the barn has undergone restoration, the original foundation and materials used during its construction still remain, keeping the structural and aesthetic properties that make the barn an important example of 19th Century rural architecture. Alongside the barns historic value is its architectural value that helped make it a heritage building. From the layout of the barn to the materials put into it, everything was thought out, intentionally or not, to present the structure as a unified whole. By laying out the different barns into one shaped as a \\u201cU\\u201d, is a design aspect used to adapt to the changing extremes of Canada\\u2019s climate condition. In recent years, Ontario\\u2019s Greenbelt has been under threat. The Greenbelt helps prevent urban sprawl from getting out of hand as well as gives Ontarians access to local food and water. While Silver Springs Farm is just one of many in the Greenbelt, it plays a vital role in the community. The farmland keeps urban areas from expanding, gives back to the community with its program for Ottawa and District Association for Persons with Developmental Disabilities and grows then sells garlic right on the farm. This is the Integrated Project Dossier compiled by a group of undergraduate students of the Architectural Conservation and Sustainability Program (Engineers and architects) at Carleton University for the CIVE3207 (ARCN4100) Historic Site Recording and Assessment course in 2019.\",\n",
